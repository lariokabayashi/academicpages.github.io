I‚Äôm a final-year Computer Engineering student at the State University of Campinas (Unicamp), currently on an academic exchange at Hamburg University of Applied Sciences (HAW Hamburg). I‚Äôm passionate about building ethical, human-centered technology through interdisciplinary collaboration.

# Selected Experience

## Professional Experience

I have experience in research, development, and interdisciplinary collaboration across academia and industry. At HAW Hamburg, I work on the DAAD-funded RESI project, developing a data literacy course to support international AI education. Previously, at the Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures Hub (H.IAAC) at Unicamp, I focused on building interpretable credit scoring explanations using large language models and explainability techniques. At the Apple Developer Academy, I led iOS development projects, four of which were published on the App Store, integrating Core ML, UX/UI design, and business strategy. Earlier, I interned at Gerdau, where I built machine learning models to forecast CO2 emissions, and participated in Unicamp‚Äôs autonomous vehicle team, contributing to real-time path planning and telemetry systems.
