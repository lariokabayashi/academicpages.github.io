      <h1>Distinguished Winner of Apple Swift Student Challenge 2025: Yume’s Spellbook</h1>
      <p><em>"Yume’s Spellbook" is an educational iOS app that gamifies training and fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) through interactive storytelling. Developed with Core ML optimizations including pruning and quantization of a GPT-2 model, the app guides users in exploring AI concepts in an accessible way. This project earned Larissa a Distinguished Winner award at the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2025 and an invitation to WWDC 2025 in Cupertino.</em></p>

      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p><em>Yume’s Spellbook</em> offers an intuitive and engaging experience where users assist Yume, a friendly wizard, in crafting magical spells. Through this metaphor, players collect ingredients such as “magical power” (computation), “raw texts” (training data), and “cooking rules” (hyperparameters) to fine-tune a GPT-2 language model.</p>
      <p>The app gamifies complex concepts behind large language models, fostering understanding and transparency without requiring technical expertise. It builds on Larissa’s previous project, <em>Yume The Wizard</em> (Swift Student Challenge 2024), which focused on fairness and interpretability in AI models.</p>

      <h2>Key Features and Motivations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interactive Storytelling:</strong> A captivating narrative guides users through the process of training and fine-tuning language models in a playful, accessible way.</li>
        <li><strong>Core ML Integration:</strong> The app runs a Core ML–optimized GPT-2 model on device, enabling secure and efficient real-time sentence completion.</li>
        <li><strong>Model Optimization:</strong> Advanced techniques like pruning, palettization, and 8-bit quantization were used to compress the original 250 MB GPT-2 model to fit Apple’s 25 MB size limit, balancing performance and file size constraints.</li>
        <li><strong>Educational Impact:</strong> By revealing the inner workings of LLMs, the app empowers users to approach AI with a critical and informed perspective.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Impact and Recognition</h2>
      <p>Larissa’s project was honored with a <strong>Distinguished Winner Award</strong> in the 2025 Apple Swift Student Challenge, recognizing her innovation, creativity, and commitment to demystifying large language models (LLMs). She was featured in the official <a href="https://www.apple.com/br/newsroom/2025/05/brazils-swift-student-challenge-winners-share-their-passions-with-the-world/" target="_blank">Apple Newsroom Article</a> highlighting the eight Brazilian Distinguished Winners who are shaping the future of inclusive and impactful technology.</p>

      <p>As part of the award, she was invited to Apple Park in Cupertino for an exclusive three-day WWDC experience, where she had the opportunity to attend live sessions, meet Apple engineers, and personally present <em>Yume’s Spellbook</em> to <strong>Apple CEO Tim Cook</strong>.</p>
